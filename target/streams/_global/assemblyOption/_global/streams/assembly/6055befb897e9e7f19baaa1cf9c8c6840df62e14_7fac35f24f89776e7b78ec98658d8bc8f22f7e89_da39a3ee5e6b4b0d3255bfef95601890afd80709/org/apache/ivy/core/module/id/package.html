<p>
This packages gathers classes used to represent identifiers of objects involved in dependency management.
</p>
<p>
As identifiers, they do not store any information on the module content and detailed metadata (like dependencies).
</p>
<h2>Classes</h2>
<dl>
<dt>ModuleId</dt><dd>is used as the identifier of module, without considering its version. It's basically an organization and module name couple.</dd>
<dt>ModuleRevisionId</dt><dd>is used as the identifier of a module in a particular version or version constraint. It is composed of a ModuleId, a revision, and optionally a branch and extra attributes.</dd>
<dt>ArtifactId</dt><dd>identifies an artifact without considering its version. It's basically a ModuleId and an artifact name, type and extension, plus optional extra attributes.</dd>
<dt>ArtifactRevisionId</dt><dd>identifies an artifact of a module in a particular version. It is composed of a ModuleRevisionId along with artifact identifier like the name type and extension.</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Text Representation</h2>
<p>
These classes share an homogeneous text representation, which can be easily obtained through the toString() method.
</p>
<p>
The general pattern is: <code>[organisation]#[module]#[branch];[revision]![artifact].[ext]([type])</code>
The # before the branch is present only if the branch is not empty.<br/>
The type and surrounding parenthesis are present only if different from the extension.
</p>
<p>
A textual representation can be parsed into an object (supported for ModuleRevisionId only yet), as long as a strict set of characters is used for each field (which is recommended).
</p>
Allowed characters are:
<dl>
<dt>organisation</dt><dd><code>a-z A-Z 0-9 - / . _ + =</code></dd>
<dt>module</dt><dd><code>a-z A-Z 0-9 - / . _ + =</code></dd>
<dt>branch</dt><dd><code>a-z A-Z 0-9 - / . _ + =</code></dd>
<dt>revision</dt><dd><code>a-z A-Z 0-9 - / . _ + = , [ ] { } ( ) : @</code></dd>
<dt>artifact</dt><dd><code>a-z A-Z 0-9 - / . _ + =</code></dd>
<dt>extension</dt><dd><code>a-z A-Z 0-9 - / . _ + =</code></dd>
<dt>type</dt><dd><code>a-z A-Z 0-9 - / . _ + =</code></dd>
</dl>
